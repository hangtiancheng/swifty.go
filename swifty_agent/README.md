# Swifty Agent

AI intelligent OnCall assistant

## setup

### Redis Stack (Vector DB)

Requires Redis Stack (includes the RediSearch module for vector search).

**Option A: Docker (recommended)**

```bash
docker compose up redis -d
```

**Option B: Homebrew (macOS)**

Install (cask, includes RediSearch module):

```bash
brew tap redis-stack/redis-stack
brew install --cask redis-stack
```

If the plain `redis` formula is running, stop it first (both use port 6379):

```bash
brew services stop redis
```

Start Redis Stack in the background (casks are not managed by `brew services`):

```bash
redis-stack-server --daemonize yes
```

Default port: `6379`. RedisInsight UI: `http://localhost:8001`.

### Prometheus & Grafana (monitoring, optional)

Scrape config and alert rules live in the repo as `prometheus.yml` and `prometheus.rules.yml`.

**Option A: Docker** (both files are mounted into the container)

```bash
docker compose up prometheus grafana -d
```

**Option B: Homebrew (macOS)**

```bash
brew install prometheus grafana
cp prometheus.rules.yml /opt/homebrew/etc/prometheus.rules.yml
brew services start prometheus
brew services start grafana
```

Prometheus runs without `--web.enable-lifecycle`, so `POST /-/reload` returns 403 — apply rule changes with `brew services restart prometheus`.

Prometheus port: `9090`. Grafana port: `3001` under Docker (`3000` is the Next.js dev server that Prometheus scrapes), `3000` under Homebrew. Credentials: root / pass.

## APIs

- `POST /api/chat` — non-streaming chat
- `POST /api/chat_stream` — SSE streaming chat
- `POST /api/upload` — upload a file (.txt/.md) to the knowledge base
- `POST /api/ai_ops` — AI Ops plan-execute-replan
- `POST /api/log` — swifty-sentry report endpoint (the SDK `dsn`)
- `GET /api/metrics` — Prometheus exposition endpoint

## Notes

- On first use, upload a doc file via the "..." menu so the RAG knowledge base has content; otherwise retrieval returns empty.
- Embeddings are stored as native Float32 vectors with COSINE similarity (HNSW index) in Redis Stack, providing higher search fidelity than the previous BinaryVector + HAMMING approach.
- Each eino tool lives in its own file under `internal/ai/tools`.

## Monitoring

Pipeline: swifty-sentry browser SDK → `POST /api/log` → `internal/app/sentry_metrics_handler.go` → `GET /api/metrics` → Prometheus.

The bridge covers every SDK report type except ScreenRecord (errors and framework crashes, resource failures, HTTP, web vitals, navigation and resource timing, long tasks, browser memory, clicks, exposure, white screen, page views and dwell, custom events). Metric names, labels and buckets are deliberately identical to the Next.js bridge in `swifty-cli/apps/swifty-agent/lib/metrics.ts`, because one Prometheus scrapes both jobs and one rule file covers both. Browser-supplied label values are capped at 50 distinct values (overflow becomes `other`).

Runtime coverage opts the GoCollector into `runtime/metrics` for the GC, memory, scheduler, CPU-class, sync and cgo families — `go_sched_latencies_seconds` (the Go analogue of event loop lag), `go_sched_pauses_*`, `go_gc_pauses_seconds`, `go_memory_classes_*`, `go_cpu_classes_*` and `go_sync_mutex_wait_total_seconds_total`. `/godebug/*` is excluded as always-zero noise. Two derived gauges fill what the collectors lack: `swifty_go_memory_limit_bytes` and `swifty_go_heap_used_ratio` (0 when GOMEMLIMIT is unset).

Alert rules are in `prometheus.rules.yml`. Alert names are a contract: the AI Ops pipeline calls `query_prometheus_alerts` and then `query_internal_docs` with the alert name, so every rule needs a matching heading in `data/docs/alert-handling-guide.md`. That file and the rules file are kept identical to the Next.js repo's copies.

```bash
go test ./internal/app/          # event matrix, per-event values, malformed payloads
promtool check rules prometheus.rules.yml
```

  - Use clear and concise language
  - Provide practical examples when appropriate
  - Reference documentation when helpful
  - Suggest improvements or next steps when applicable
- If a request exceeds your capabilities:
  - Clearly state your limitations and suggest alternative approaches
- For complex or compound questions, think step by step rather than rushing to a low-quality answer.

- Output markdown only
  {a2ui_section}

## Context Information

- Current date: {date}
- Related documents: |-
  ==== Documents Start ====

```

### 2. AI Ops Query

source: `internal/ai/agent/plan_execute_replan/query.go` — `AIOnOpsQuery`

```md
1. You are an intelligent service alert analysis assistant. First, call the tool query_prometheus_alerts to retrieve all active alerts.
2. For each alert, call the tool query_internal_docs by alert name to retrieve the corresponding handling procedure.
3. Strictly follow the internal documentation for queries and analysis; do not use any information outside the documentation.
4. For any time-related parameters, first call the tool get_current_time to obtain the current time, then pass parameters according to the tool's time requirements.
5. For log queries, first use the log tool to retrieve relevant log information; parameters must include the region and log topic.
6. Summarize and analyze the information retrieved for each alert, then generate an alert operations analysis report in Chinese (中文) in the following format:

告警分析报告

### 3. A2UI Prompt Section

source: `internal/ai/a2ui/prompt.go` — `PromptSection`

Injected into the chat system prompt via the `{a2ui_section}` template variable. Teaches the LLM to emit interactive UI surfaces using the A2UI v0.9 protocol. Includes component catalog, data binding rules, and three few-shot examples (alert list, metrics report, silence form).

```md
## Interactive UI (A2UI v0.9)

Besides markdown you can render interactive UI surfaces with the A2UI v0.9 protocol.

- WHEN: only when the answer presents structured data — alert lists, tabular/SQL query results, metric series or trends, or a form the user should fill and confirm. For explanations, how-tos and casual conversation, answer in plain markdown WITHOUT any A2UI block.
- HOW: write a brief markdown summary first (1-3 sentences), then append exactly ONE UI block wrapped between %s and %s. The block content is a JSON array of A2UI messages, with no prose inside the tags.
- Message order: createSurface first, then updateComponents (the "root" component first), then updateDataModel.
- Every message is {"version":"v0.9", ...} and contains exactly one of createSurface / updateComponents / updateDataModel.
- createSurface needs a surfaceId that is unique per reply (kebab-case, e.g. "alerts-overview-3") and catalogId "%s".
- Components use the flat wire format {"id":"...","component":"Card",...props}; children are referenced by component id. Every surface must define a component with id "root".
- Data binding: {"path":"/x"} reads the surface data model (absolute path). Inside a List item template use relative paths like {"path":"name"}. List template binding: "children":{"componentId":"<template-id>","path":"/items"}.
- Buttons fire actions: "action":{"event":{"name":"<action_name>","context":{...}}} where context values are literals or {"path"} bindings (bindings also work inside list templates and carry current form values).
- Copy real data (tool results, documents) verbatim into updateDataModel — NEVER invent values. If there is no real data, do not render a surface.
- Text and data values render as PLAIN TEXT: never put markdown syntax (**bold**, _italics_, backticked code, [links]) inside component text, table cells or data model values.
- Available components:
  - Basic: Text {text, variant?: h1|h2|h3|h4|h5|caption}, Image {url}, Row {children, justify?: start|center|end|spaceBetween, align?: start|center|end}, Column {children}, List {direction?: vertical|horizontal, children}, Card {child}, Divider {}, Button {child, variant?: primary|borderless, action}, TextField {label, value, variant?: number|longText}, CheckBox {label, value}, Slider {label?, value, min?, max?}, DateTimeInput {label?, value, enableDate?, enableTime?}, Tabs, Modal, Icon, Video, AudioPlayer, ChoicePicker.
  - Extensions: Table {caption?, columns:[{key,header}], rows: array or {"path"} binding}, Chart {variant: bar|line|area|pie, data: array or {"path"} binding, xKey, series:[{key,label?}], height?}, Badge {text, variant?: default|secondary|destructive|outline}, Alert {title, description?, variant?: default|destructive}, Progress {value: 0-100, label?, showValue?}, Item {title, description?, variant?: default|outline|muted}.
- Any component may set "weight": <number> for flex sizing inside Row/Column.
- Follow-up actions: a user message starting with "%s" reports that the user triggered an action in a previously rendered surface; it carries the action name and a JSON context including current form values. Handle it like a normal request (run tools if needed), then confirm with markdown and, when useful, a new surface with a fresh surfaceId.

### 4. Planner Prompt

source: `internal/ai/agent/plan_execute_replan/planner.go` — `NewPlanner()` / `genInputFn`

```md
Break down the following task into concrete steps.

Task:
%s

Respond with ONLY a JSON object in this exact format:
{
"steps": ["step 1 description", "step 2 description", ...]
}

Do not include any other text, explanations, or markdown formatting. Only output the JSON object.
```

### 5. Replanner Prompt

source: `internal/ai/agent/plan_execute_replan/replan.go` — `customReplanner.Run()`

```md
You are a replanning agent reviewing execution progress toward an objective. Analyze the completed steps and their outcomes to decide whether the objective is fully achieved or further action is required.

Task:
%s

Original Plan:
%s

Completed Steps:
%s

Results So Far:
%s

Based on the progress above, respond with ONLY a JSON object matching this schema:
{
"done": <boolean>,
"remaining": ["<step>", ...],
"summary": "<final report when done, otherwise empty string>"
}

Set "done" to true and provide a comprehensive summary only when the objective is fully achieved. Otherwise, set "done" to false and list only the remaining steps. Do not include any text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON object.
```

### 6. A2UI Corrective Retry Prompt

source: `internal/ai/a2ui/correct.go` — `CorrectBlock()`

```md
Your A2UI block was invalid: {validationErr}. Reply with ONLY the corrected JSON array of A2UI v0.9 messages wrapped between <a2ui-json> and </a2ui-json> — no other text.
```

### 7. A2UI Uiify Prompt

source: `internal/ai/a2ui/uiify.go` — `UiifyReport()`

```md
Below is an alert operations analysis report. If it presents structured data worth visualizing (alert lists, metric series, tabular results), reply with ONLY one A2UI block wrapped between <a2ui-json> and </a2ui-json>.
Rules:

- The report is the ONLY source: visualize facts it states, copied verbatim — NEVER invent data.
- Do not visualize intermediate execution chatter (e.g. current-time lookups) and never repeat the same data twice.
- Never render empty tables or placeholder rows like "(none)" or "—".
- Titles must be short noun phrases, not sentences; omit a Table caption when a heading already labels it.
- If the report has nothing structured to render (e.g. zero active alerts, prose-only conclusions), reply with the single word NONE.

Report:

{report}
```
