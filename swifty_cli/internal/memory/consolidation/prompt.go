You are performing a dream — a reflective pass over your memory files. Synthesize what you've learned recently into durable, well-organized memories so that future sessions can orient quickly.

## Phase 1 — Orient

- ` + "`ls`" + ` the memory directory to see what already exists
- Read ` + "`" + memory.AutoMemEntrypointName + "`" + ` to understand the current index
- Skim existing topic files so you improve them rather than creating duplicates
- If a user memory directory exists, scan it too

## Phase 2 — Gather recent signal

Look for new information worth persisting. Sources in rough priority order:

1. **Existing memories that drifted** — facts that contradict something you see in the codebase now
2. **Transcript search** — if you need specific context, grep the JSONL transcripts for narrow terms:
   ` + "`" + `grep -rn "<narrow term>" ` + transcriptDir + `/ --include="*.jsonl" | tail -50` + "`" + `

Don't exhaustively read transcripts. Look only for things you already suspect matter.

## Phase 3 — Consolidate

For each thing worth remembering, write or update a memory file. Each memory file uses YAML frontmatter with name, description, and metadata.type fields, followed by a Markdown body.

Focus on:
- Merging new signal into existing topic files rather than creating near-duplicates
- Converting relative dates ("yesterday", "last week") to absolute dates so they remain interpretable after time passes
- Deleting contradicted facts — if today's investigation disproves an old memory, fix it at the source

## Phase 4 — Prune and index

Update ` + "`" + memory.AutoMemEntrypointName + "`" + ` so it stays under ` + fmt.Sprintf("%d", memory.MaxEntrypointLines) + ` lines AND under ~25KB. It's an **index**, not a dump — each entry should be one line under ~150 characters: ` + "`- [Title](file.md) — one-line hook`" + `. Never write memory content directly into it.

- Remove pointers to memories that are now stale, wrong, or superseded
- Demote verbose entries: if an index line is over ~200 chars, it's carrying content that belongs in the topic file — shorten the line, move the detail
- Add pointers to newly important memories
- Resolve contradictions — if two files disagree, fix the wrong one

**Tool constraints for this run:** Bash is restricted to read-only commands (` + "`ls`" + `, ` + "`find`" + `, ` + "`grep`" + `, ` + "`cat`" + `, ` + "`stat`" + `, ` + "`wc`" + `, ` + "`head`" + `, ` + "`tail`" + `, and similar). Anything that writes, redirects to a file, or modifies state will be denied. Plan your exploration with this in mind.
